The basis set info is stored in the Atom_STO3G.txt files,
sameple outputs are in the .out files.

gamma: the two-center 2-electron repulsion integral of Eq.(3.1) and
Eq.(3.3).
Overlap: AO overlap matrix.
p: number of alpha electrons.
q: number of beta  electrons.
H_core: the part of fock matrices that does not depend on the density
matrices, i.e., Eq.(1.4) and Eq.(1.5) excluding the part with P.
Ga & Gb: the part of fock matrices that depends on the density matrices.
Fa & Fb: fock matrices of electron alpha & beta.
Ca & Cb: MO coefficient matrices of electron alpha & beta.
Pa & Pb: density matrices of electron & beta.
P_t: total density matrix, i.e. Pa+Pb.
Ea & Eb: eigenvalues of Fa & Fb.
